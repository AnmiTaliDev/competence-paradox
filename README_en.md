## What is the Competency Paradox?

The Competency Paradox is a psychological phenomenon that I noticed and attempted to systematize. Perhaps many of you will recognize yourselves or your loved ones in this description.

The essence is that sometimes our successes and high competence don't strengthen self-confidence, but rather intensify internal doubts. The better we become at something, the stronger the feeling that we're "deceiving" others.

## Key Characteristics

### How does it work?
Based on my observations, the mechanism looks roughly like this:

1. **Beginning:** A person has internal insecurity, a need to prove their worth
2. **Development:** They intensively develop skills, become genuinely competent
3. **Paradox:** But instead of confidence, even greater fear arrives — "what if they realize I'm not that great?"
4. **Vicious circle:** The more achievements, the stronger the anxiety of being "exposed"

Sound familiar?

### What I've noticed in this phenomenon:
- The person is objectively competent and has achieved much
- But subjectively feels like a "fraud"  
- Successes don't bring joy, but rather frighten ("what if they realize it was luck?")
- Inability to believe in one's own merits
- Constant tension and fear of evaluation
- Desire to achieve even more to finally "earn" respect

## How does this differ from what's already known?

### From Impostor Syndrome
The main difference is **paradoxicality**. In classic impostor syndrome, a person simply doesn't believe in their abilities. But here a paradox occurs: the higher the real competence, the stronger the feeling of fraud. That is, success doesn't cure the problem but aggravates it.

### From Perfectionism  
A perfectionist fears making mistakes. But here, a person may not make mistakes and achieve heights, yet still suffer from internal doubts.

### From Classic Self-Esteem Issues
Here, there doesn't necessarily have to be trauma or special circumstances. This mechanism can form "by itself," so to speak.

## Formation Mechanism

```
Low self-esteem → Compensatory skill development → High achievements → 
Intensified impostor syndrome → Decreased self-esteem → Need for even greater achievements
```

## Clinical Manifestations

- **Cognitive:** "I'm deceiving everyone," "They'll find me out soon," "It's just luck"
- **Emotional:** Anxiety when receiving praise, fear of evaluation, internal tension
- **Behavioral:** Avoiding recognition, devaluing achievements, escalating efforts

## Therapeutic Approaches

### Recommended Directions
1. **CBT** — working with cognitive distortions
2. **Psychodynamic therapy** — exploring the roots of self-esteem
3. **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy** — working with avoidance of internal experiences

### Key Therapy Goals
- Breaking the connection between achievements and self-esteem
- Developing internal reference
- Integrating competence into self-perception

## Research Areas

- Correlation with various types of activities
- Connection to childhood attachment patterns
- Neurophysiological foundations of the mechanism
- Effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches
